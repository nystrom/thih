# thih

Mark Jones' Typing Haskell in Haskell

Based on the Nov 23, 2000 version from [https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/thih/](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/thih/).

Modified to build with Haskell 2010 and to use stack.

- fixed imports
- changed `TIMonad` to be a `State` monad.
- moved test code to `tests` directory (currently not running, though)
